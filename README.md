# ASCII Art Generator
ASCII Art Generator

A simple program that generates ASCII art from a given image. This program works best with images with a simple/white background.

### How it works:
Finds the image in the folder, converts it to greyscale and resizes it. For each pixel in the new image, an "ASCII" symbol is assigned based on the pixel's brightness and then appended to a string. This string is then written to a .txt file, which becomes the final, editable render of the image in it's new ASCII art format.
